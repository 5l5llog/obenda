#The Obenda Music Band

##Overview
The project has created a website which helps the band showcase their music and publicise their upcoming gigs. It contains a page with some multimedia examples of the band’s music. This allows the viewer to sample some of the band’s songs and get a flavour of their genre. 
The website has an easy to use, intuitive design which will appeal to the casual browsing music fan. It is dynamic and functions equally well on PC and mobile devices. It has been optimised to work on all of the common web browsers.
As a clean and visually attractive interface, the website not only allows the user easy navigation but also projects an air of modernity. This will help the band appeal to a new audience, whilst not alienating their fans of over 50 years standing.
